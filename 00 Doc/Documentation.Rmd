1) This program uses SQL to assign all of the Titanic data to a dataframe and then prints out a subset and summary of the data.
```{r}
source("../01 Data/Database.R", echo = TRUE)
```

***

2) These sections of code run ggplot() programs which produce each of the required plots of Titanic Data.
```{r eval = TRUE}
source("../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot01.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot02.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot03.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot04.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot05.R", echo = TRUE)
```


3) We designed the last plot ourselves and it shows the survival rates of people over the age of 50, compared to which class they were in.
```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot06.R", echo = TRUE)
```
